  <h1>What is SaveState?</h1>
  <p>
    SaveState is an application that houses training files created in
    UnclePunch's Training Mode. These files can be uploaded by anyone who
    creates an account. No more having to share files in Discord servers!
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h1>How do I download a training file?</h1>
  <p>
    Navigate to our search page, and choose some filters. The only required
    filter is "Character", all others are optional to help you narrow down your
    search.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h1>I've downloaded a training file, now what?</h1>
  <p>
    First, open up Dolphin, go to Config, then click the GameCube tab. Make sure
    under "Device Settings" that "Slot A" has "GCI Folder" selected. Next, open
    your file explorer on your local computer, and navigate to the folder where
    your Dolphin files are stored. Once there, follow the directory path:
    "User/GC/USA/Card A/". Place the .gci file that you downloaded from
    SaveState into that folder. Boot up Training Mode, go to Training Lab, click
    on "Import", and the file should show up in the list of trainings.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h1>How do I upload a training file?</h1>
  <p>
    Go to the "Upload" page. There, you will be prompted to select a .gci file
    to upload. Navigate to the same folder as detailed in the section above, and
    choose the training file you want to upload. Next, fill out all the relevant
    information, and please make sure it is all accurate. Click "Upload", and
    you should see a dialog confirming that the upload was successful!
