    <h1>What is SaveState?</h1>
    <p>SaveState is an application that houses training files created in
       UnclePunch's Training Mode. These files can be uploaded by anyone
       who creates an account. No more having to share files in Discord servers!</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>How do I download a training file?</h1>
    <p>Navigate to our search page, and choose some filters. The only required
       filter is "Character", all others are optional to help you narrow down
       your search.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>I've downloaded a training file, now what?</h1>
    <p>First, open up Dolphin, go to Config, then click the GameCube tab. Make sure
       under "Device Settings" that "Slot A" has "GCI Folder" selected. Next,
       open your file explorer on your local computer, and navigate to the folder
       where your Dolphin files are stored. Once there, follow the directory path:
       "User/GC/USA/Card A/". Place the .gci file that you downloaded from SaveState
       into that folder. Boot up Training Mode, go to Training Lab, click on "Import",
       and the file should show up in the list of trainings.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>How do I upload a training file?</h1>
    <p>Go to the "Upload" page. There, you will be prompted to select a .gci file to
       upload. Navigate to the same folder as detailed in the section above, and choose
       the training file you want to upload. Next, fill out all the relevant information,
       and please make sure it is all accurate. Click "Upload", and you should see a dialog
       confirming that the upload was successful!</p>
